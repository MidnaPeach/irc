Welcome to your IRC project on Cloud9 IDE!

####Dependencies
`sudo easy_install flask-socketio`

# IRC Project 1

## Partner (or Individual) task

### Piazza & In-Person Guidelines
1. Feel free to discuss how the provided code works.
2. You are not to show to any part of your code --even elided versions of your code-- to anyone.
  * If you are looking for help you cannot show your code
  * If you are providing help to someone you cannot show your code.
3. Feel free to share online resources (other than those that are a direct cut-and-paste solution to his task).
4. Feel free to answer questions that are not code based. For ex., *I think you created a new workspace and forgot to install flask -> sudo easy_install flask*
5. Any question/answer exchanges that are entirely in English are fine (i.e., not sharing code snippets).


### Deliverables for First Sprint
1. Login working -- only people who are logged in can chat.
2. Messages stored in database. 
3. When a user logs in they will see some list of previous messages. 
4. Search. I can search for a particular term and see the results.
 
### You must host your code on github


we still need to :
    cake is great!
    - do search stuff
    - make it fail gracefully when user is not in the thing

Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
